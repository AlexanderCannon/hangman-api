# Hangman Game API 😵

## What is it? 🤷‍♀️
A fun api to allow you to play hangman with a computer when your friends are all too busy. 🏈👨‍👨‍👦‍👦

## What is it using?

Under the hood it's running [node 10](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/) with [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session). 🚀

## Why?

🥋I wanted to write a React hangman game, but I decided that crafty developers would find the word in the store too easily. 🤺

🛡 I decided to make an API which tracks the game, making it harder for people to cheat, by storing the word on the server! 🗝

## How do I run this myself?
### Pre-requisites

[`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), & [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)*(optional)*
🛠 Clone the repo and then run the install command:
```bash
$ yarn
```
⚔️Then start the server with:
```bash
$ yarn start
```
😎 Easy as pie! 🥧
## This project is a WIP
😊 The rules for the game aren't fully fleshed out. 🎮
😔 No tests yet. 🗜
📒 Check back soon for an article about how I created the game and for the React front-end! 🤓
